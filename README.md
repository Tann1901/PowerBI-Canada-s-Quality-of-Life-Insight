In this report, I imported four different tables and generated five distinct charts.

Upon examining the sense of belonging among various communities in Canada, I made an interesting discovery. The Arab, Filipino, South Asian, and Latin American groups emerged as the top-ranking communities in terms of their strong sense of belonging. This sense of belonging was closely linked to their active involvement in the local community.

When it comes to the most commonly spoken language at home, English took the lead with a prevalence of 75.39%, followed by French at 20.36% and English & French bilingual at 1.67% The remaining percentage was distributed among other languages with a rate of 2.59%.

Regarding satisfaction with personal relationships, the majority of respondents (over 60%) rated their satisfaction levels between 8 and 10 on average. The highest satisfaction rate of 71% was reported in Newfoundland and Labrador, while the lowest rate of 60% was observed in British Columbia. The range of satisfaction ratings between 6 and 7 varied from 18% to 24% across different areas, with British Columbia having the highest rate at 24%. For satisfaction ratings between 0 and 5, the range was between 12% and 18%, with the highest percentage reported in Manitoba.

In terms of daily time allocation, the study found that on average, 10.8% of respondents' time was dedicated to sleeping and personal activities. Paid work activities accounted for 3.20% of the time, unpaid work took up 3%, and passive leisure activities occupied 2.4%. Active leisure activities only accounted for 1% of the time, while socializing accounted for 0.9%. The remaining time was allocated to transportation, study, and other activities, based on the average responses of individuals aged 15 years and above.

## Health

Examining Canada's quality of life across four vital health domains reveals trends and challenges. Life expectancy, a key indicator, demonstrated a positive trajectory over the last four decades. Despite this overall progress, the year 2020 marked a departure from the upward trend due to the impact of COVID-19 and substance-related harms. In 2020, life expectancy at birth in Canada averaged 81.7 years, with males and females anticipating 79.5 and 84.0 years, respectively. Notably, the gender gap in life expectancy has been gradually narrowing.

Healthcare accessibility, a critical facet of well-being, showed that while 85.5% of Canadians reported having a regular healthcare provider in 2021, nearly 2.5 million individuals (7.9% of the population) experienced unmet healthcare needs. This proportion varied regionally, with the Atlantic provinces reporting a higher share of unmet needs at 10.7%, compared to the rest of Canada. Gender differences were evident, with females (8.9%) more likely than males (6.9%) to report unmet healthcare needs.

A comprehensive analysis of general health across age groups highlighted intriguing patterns. In 2021, individuals aged 65 and older reported a lower proportion of very good or excellent general health compared to other age groups. Positive mental health exhibited an intriguing age-related dynamic, with the highest levels observed among children and youth, a dip among those aged 18 to 34, and an increase with advancing age.

Mental health disparities, especially across genders and age groups (2015-2021), were noteworthy. A lower proportion of females, particularly in the 12 to 17 age group, reported very good or excellent general and mental health compared to males. This emphasizes the urgency of targeted interventions to address mental health challenges, particularly among the youth demographic.

The data underscores the importance of tailored strategies to address healthcare disparities, mental health concerns, and evolving demographic health needs in the pursuit of a holistic and inclusive well-being framework for the nation.

## Environment

In the environment report, we discussed 4 indicators which include greenhouse gas emissions,  climate change adaptation, drinking water and conserved areas with 4 distinct charts.

In terms of Greenhouse gas emissions in different regions of Canada, in a 5-year period, Ontario is the province with the highest number of households, followed by Quebec, it shows that the greenhouse gas emissions and the population size are aligned. Alberta is the province with the highest emissions in industries. New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, and Manitoba, account for a minimal share of emissions in both graphs because they are not rich enough in population and industrial resources.

The second indicator assesses the integration of climate change adaptation into decision-making processes among municipal organizations. Notably, stormwater takes precedence in both urban and rural areas over three different years, followed by wastewater, with solid waste being the least prioritized.
Analyzing boil water advisories from 2010 to 2021, the percentage of advisories issued on a precautionary basis due to E. coli and microbiological parameters decreased, while those related to equipment and processes increased, constituting over 90% of advisories in 2021.
Concerning conserved areas, crucial for biodiversity preservation, Canada recorded significant achievements by the end of 2022. The nation conserved 13.6% of its terrestrial area, with a notable 12.7% in protected areas. Similarly, marine territory conservation reached 14.7%, including 9.1% in protected areas. Noteworthy is the remarkable increase in both terrestrial area conservation and marine area conservation in the last 5 years. These achievements underscore Canada's commitment to safeguarding biodiversity for current and future generations, mitigating the impact of human activities on the environment

## Prosperity

The material well-being of Canadians is grounded in the opportunities coming from a thriving and innovative economy. Essential factors include the affordability of necessities like housing, food, and utilities, coupled with a sense of financial security in both unforeseen circumstances and retirement. All of these make up the prosperity domain and measure economic success. For this report, we focus on the following subdomains:
Youth in employment with or without education
Wages based on industry
Household debts
Household wealth

The bar chart located in the upper-left section illustrates the percentage of citizens with low income for the years 2020 and 2021. Notably, it highlights a consistent trend where individuals aged 18 to 64 constitute the majority of the population falling within the lowest income bracket. This observation raises concerns, as this demographic is generally considered to be in their prime working years, representing a significant portion of the workforce. The prevalent occurrence of low-income earners within this age group prompts the need for a more in-depth investigation to discern the underlying factors contributing to this trend. Understanding the dynamics at play will be crucial in formulating targeted strategies to address and potentially improve the economic well-being of individuals in their prime working age.

Examining the trend in debts over the reviewed years, it becomes clear that mortgage debt remained consistently prominent as the primary financial obligation among citizens. This pattern makes sense considering that mortgage debt typically represents a significant and long-term financial commitment for individuals. The stability of mortgage debt as a leading form of indebtedness may also reflect the prevailing economic conditions and housing market dynamics during the review period. Factors such as interest rates, housing prices, and access to credit can influence the prevalence of mortgage debt within the population. 
Understanding the continued significance of mortgage debt provides valuable insights for policymakers, financial institutions, and individuals alike. It highlights the importance of housing-related financial decisions in the lives of citizens and emphasizes the need for informed policies on housing.

Moving on to the wages; the hourly wage rates in both the service and goods sectors have consistently risen over the five years, indicating an alignment with inflation. good to note, however, that wages in the service sector lag behind those in the goods-producing sector. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the nature of jobs in the service sector, often involving roles in retail, hospitality, or customer service, tends to have lower wage scales compared to the goods-producing sector, which includes manufacturing and construction jobs that may require specialized skills. Additionally, differences in demand and supply for labour in these sectors can influence wage differentials. The goods-producing sector may face a higher demand for skilled labour, contributing to relatively higher wages, whereas the service sector may have a larger pool of available workers, potentially impacting wage levels.

Finally, we explore the makeup of the workforce, focusing on individuals who are employed and whether they attended a tertiary institution. A striking observation is that the majority of employed citizens did not pursue tertiary education. This observation implies several useful considerations. Primarily, the dominance of individuals without tertiary education in the workforce may indicate the prevalence of jobs that do not require tertiary degrees. Certain industries and occupations may prioritize practical skills or on-the-job experience over formal education qualifications. Additionally, this could reflect challenges or barriers to accessing tertiary education, such as financial constraints, limited educational opportunities, or the pursuit of alternative career paths that do not require higher education. Understanding the composition of the labour force in terms of educational attainment is crucial for shaping educational policies, workforce development initiatives, and employment opportunities. It highlights the importance of a diversified approach to education and employment strategies that cater to the diverse needs and qualifications of the workforce.

## Good Governance
![image](https://github.com/Tann1901/PowerBI-Canada-s-Quality-of-Life-Insight/assets/108020327/d5b83fba-c44a-4274-bb2e-56cc4636d95f)

In any well-functioning society, it is essential to safeguard the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, fostering their active engagement in civil life and assuring them that their perspectives are valued. The reliability of public institutions is paramount, ensuring equitable treatment and a sense of security for all, thereby granting access to vital public services in Canada. These make up the good governance domain with the dashboard in Fig 4.6.1 above highlighting relevant insights for the following sub-domains

Crime severity index
Child maltreatment
Incarceration
Confidence in public institutions.

The chart located in the upper-left section of the dashboard illustrates the incarceration rates spanning the years 2017 to 2021. These rates, expressed as a proportion per 10,000 adults and a proportion of 10,000 youths, signify the proportion of individuals convicted of crimes and serving jail sentences. The graph specifically highlights 2017/2018 as the peak year for incarceration with over 80K incarcerations that year during the reviewed period, followed by a gradual decline in subsequent years. The notable decrease in 2021 with under 36k can be attributed to the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns, but the rates have persisted at lower levels post-pandemic. It would be beneficial for the country to investigate the factors influencing incarceration rates since 2018, especially given the substantial influx of immigrants into the nation.

The chart in the upper-right corner illustrates the percentage of Canadians surveyed in 2018 who have encountered some form of sexual abuse at the age of 15 or older. This falls within the child maltreatment subdomain of good governance. The graph highlights that the highest proportion of individuals reporting child sexual abuse is in the age group of 55 years and older, (about 37%) while the lowest occurrences are among those aged 15 to 24 (about 10%) This pattern suggests that recent government interventions aimed at child protection, including the enactment of various policies and the criminalization of offences against children, may be influencing the reduction in reported cases, particularly among the younger generation. (Source: Public Health Agency of Canada, 2019).

The Crime severity chart visualizes the quantity of crime reported to the police (violent and non-violent crime) and their relative severity. It highlights its rate from 2018-2022 ( 75 index value) and shows a dip in 2020 (73); which possibly is due to the pandemic and lockdowns and subsequent peak after 2022, a time when the economy experienced re-opening post-pandemic. While the crime severity index has fluctuated, the violent crime index has seen a steady rise and peak in 2022. This is explained possibly by the rise in population since 2018.

Finally under good governance is the confidence in public institutions which measures to what extent the public and citizens are confident in the activities of public institutions. For this report, we focused on police service, justice systems and courts and the federal parliament. It's important to highlight that individuals within the black visible minority group consistently reported the lowest average confidence levels. The reason for this trend requires further investigation and analysis to understand the specific factors contributing to lower confidence within the black visible minority demographic. Additional research and examination of socio-economic, cultural, and systemic influences may provide insights into the root causes of this observed pattern.

## Challenge
It was important and Challenging for this report how the key indicators for each domain of The Quality of Life (QoL) Framework were selected and presented in a way that best characterizes each domain and gives validity to the message. In addition, the surveys conducted for this report were carried out over different periods, which may result in inconsistencies in certain values. These variations in time frames could potentially influence the current overview and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, The Quality of Life Framework for Canada showed that good trends were in Health and Environment. People's life expectancy is increasing, mental health problems are declining, and awareness of environmental protection is increasing. These two domains in particular are indicators that show results from ongoing policies, so it can be said that effective measures have been taken over the long term.
On the other hand, in the Prosperity domain, the poverty rate has increased and mortgage debt has continued to rise, while in the Governance domain, there has been an increase in the violent crime rate. This suggests that some measures are needed to address the economic and safety situations. The sense of community belonging among minority groups in the Society domain is not consistent with their population ratios in Canada. This may be a sign that more inclusive policies are needed.
